Little webapp to learn how to use third part APIs and Flask server.
Insert a the name of a film in the textbox and choose your current region, in order to see where you can stream it!

If you wanna run it in local, you need a working API key. Add that to your env variables with the name X_RAPIDAPI_KEY.

Enjoy!
